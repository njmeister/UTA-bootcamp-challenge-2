# UTA Coding Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description

This is my submission for the second challenge in the UTA/EdX Coding Bootcamp. The goal of this challenge was to create a sample portfolio using HTML and CSS.
I created a site with rudimentary About Me, Portfolio, and Contact me sections that I can update as I gain more experience through this course and elsewhere.
